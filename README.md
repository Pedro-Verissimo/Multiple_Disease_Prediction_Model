## Installation

To get started with the Multiple Disease Prediction Model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pedro-Verissimo/Multiple_Disease_Prediction_Model.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Multiple_Disease_Prediction_Model
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   Use pip to install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras xgboost
   ```

4. **Download the Model**:
   You can download the latest model from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Pedro-Verissimo/Multiple_Disease_Prediction_Model/releases). After downloading, execute the model as per the instructions provided in the `usage` section.

## Usage

To use the Multiple Disease Prediction Model, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your data is in the correct format. The model expects a CSV file with features that correspond to the trained model.

2. **Load the Model**:
   Load the trained model using the following code:
   ```python
   import pickle

   with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
       model = pickle.load(file)
   ```

3. **Make Predictions**:
   Use the model to make predictions:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Load your data
   data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

   # Make predictions
   predictions = model.predict(data)
   print(predictions)
   ```

4. **Visualize Results**:
   You can visualize the predictions using Matplotlib:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   plt.bar(range(len(predictions)), predictions)
   plt.title('Disease Predictions')
   plt.xlabel('Samples')
   plt.ylabel('Prediction')
   plt.show()
   ```

## Model Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of the model is crucial. You can use various metrics to assess accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Hereâ€™s how to evaluate the model:

1. **Split Your Data**:
   Use Scikit-learn to split your data into training and testing sets:
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

2. **Train the Model**:
   Train your chosen classifier:
   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

   classifier = RandomForestClassifier()
   classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

3. **Make Predictions**:
   Predict on the test set:
   ```python
   y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
   ```

4. **Evaluate the Model**:
   Use metrics to evaluate:
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

   print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
   print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
   ```
